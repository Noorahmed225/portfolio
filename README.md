## React source structure

JSX components use `.jsx` extensions and each UI component has a colocated `.css` file. Existing Tailwind utility classes and global styles are preserved to avoid changing the current features or appearance.

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push the project to GitHub (`.env` is git-ignored).
2. Import the repo in Vercel. Framework preset: **Create React App** (auto-detected, `vercel.json` already sets it).
3. Add the three `REACT_APP_EMAILJS_*` variables under Project Settings > Environment Variables, then deploy.
   These are baked in at build time, so redeploy after changing them.
